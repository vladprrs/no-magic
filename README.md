### Problem Statement:

Organizations without an IT focus face challenges in developing digital solutions. Many non-technical companies, such as those in retail or FMCG, seek to automate processes but face limited options:

1. No-code platforms involve vendor lock-in, which brings risks like sudden pricing changes or vendor shutdowns. They are also restrictive, preventing users from implementing exactly what they need.
2. LLM-based code generation produces results that are hard for non-developers to understand, complicating future development.
3. Hiring developers is slow, expensive, and requires specialized knowledge to manage and validate effectively.

These issues lead to delayed development cycles, increased costs, and misalignment between business needs and technical execution.

### Solution Overview:

Our platform solves these challenges by turning business requirements into functional software.

**Conversational Interface & Visual Workflow**: Non-technical users can specify needs through a chatbot UI, translating them into structured business workflows.

**Code Generator**: Generates service code directly from business process descriptions without relying on LLMs, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

The Manifest Editing Tool enables users to manage business entities and workflows, while the Code Generator transforms these specifications into robust code, optimized for deployment. By automating repetitive tasks, incorporating security practices, and supporting testing, the platform significantly reduces development timelines.

### Customer Benefits:

- Accelerated Development: Quickly prototype and develop IT solutions, reducing time-to-market.
- User-Friendly Interface: Minimal technical knowledge required to define workflows and business logic.
- High-Quality Code: Maintains standards compliance, reducing the load on developers.

### FAQs

- Who is this platform for? Business Analysts, Product Managers, and Developers who need a faster way to convert business logic into working software.
- How does it reduce development time? By using manifests to generate code automatically, reducing manual coding and enabling rapid prototyping.
